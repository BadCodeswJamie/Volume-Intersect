# Volume-Intersect
Change windows volume key increments with Auto Hotkey(normally pressing the vol up key it increases the volume by 2)

Place ahk file in start up folder(found easily with win+r and inputting shell:startup)

Prerequisites:
- AutoHotkey v2 installed https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe
- Windows OS(works in w11 for me)

Notes: 
  I cannot code with ahk and through searching for a solution to my problem(making a digispark volume knob with resolution 
 of 1% volume) i managed to make this code and i wanted to make it more accessible.
  99% of the code is from this reddit thread https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoHotkey/comments/xn2x65/autohotkey_2_volume_up_and_down/

  https://github.com/shajul/Autohotkey/blob/master/Live/Volume/Volume%20Control.ahk (just found this and it appears(?) to do something similar)
